## AT record metadata (AT Tags)

Use `AtTags` to let other clients discover which AT Protocol records and identities
an HTML page represents. It renders server-side `<meta name="at:…" content="at://…">`
tags in the document head and updates/removes them when its props change. It needs
no theme, styles, network requests, or app state.

The [AT Tags proposal](https://tangled.org/chrisshank.com/at-tags) is a draft. Its four
standard relationships are:

| Property    | Meaning                                                                  | Content         |
| ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------ | --------------- |
| `canonical` | The record this page represents; deleting it would remove the page.      | A record AT URI |
| `alternate` | Auxiliary records shown or referenced; the page survives their deletion. | A record AT URI |
| `author`    | Account(s) who authored the page's content.                              | `at://<DID>`    |
| `me`        | Account(s) this site or section belongs to.                              | `at://<DID>`    |

Each property accepts an array; multiple values produce separate tags, with exact
duplicates removed within each property. Use meta **names**, not Open Graph
`property` attributes or `<link href="at://…">`. These tags supplement—not
replace—your title, description, HTTPS canonical URL and Open Graph metadata.

For a page backed by one record authored by its repository owner, use the
framework-free `recordAtTags` helper in your server loader:

```ts
import { recordAtTags } from '@atmo-dev/kit/at-tags';

// After app-owned loading, visibility/moderation checks and handle resolution:
return {
	atTags: recordAtTags(record, relatedRecords)
};
```

`record` and each optional `relatedRecords` entry only need `{ uri: string }`.
The helper sets `canonical`, derives `author` from the record's repository DID,
and lists related records as `alternate`, excluding the canonical URI. It throws
`SyntaxError` for non-record or handle-based URIs: pass resolved DID-based record
URIs, not a URL path or viewer parameter. It does not resolve or fetch anything.

Render the metadata once in a SvelteKit root layout (covering embeds too):

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { page } from '$app/state';
	import { AtTags } from '@atmo-dev/kit';

	let { children } = $props();
</script>

<AtTags tags={page.error ? undefined : page.data.atTags} />
{@render children()}
```

Add `atTags?: import('@atmo-dev/kit/at-tags').AtTagMetadata` to `App.PageData`.
In other Svelte apps, pass the current page's metadata directly; set `tags` to
`undefined` on pages with no relationships. Do not mount competing tag owners.

You can supply `AtTagMetadata` directly for multiple canonical records, different
or additional authors, or an account section:

```ts
import type { AtTagMetadata } from '@atmo-dev/kit/at-tags';

const atTags: AtTagMetadata = {
	me: [`at://${profile.did}`],
	alternate: profile.uri ? [profile.uri] : []
};
```

An account's events page might survive deletion of its optional Bluesky profile,
so that profile record is an alternate, not necessarily canonical. Likewise,
embedded comments are alternate records, not the page's authors. `me` is not the
signed-in viewer or every record author; do not assign it site-wide unless the
site actually belongs to that account. Ordinary discovery and creation pages
usually have no canonical record.

Apps own these semantic choices, record loading, identity resolution, visibility,
and error-page suppression. The component escapes attributes but does not validate
raw metadata or verify record existence. Use record URIs with collection and rkey,
and bare `at://<DID>` identity URIs without a trailing slash. Only the four standard
properties are supported; parsing/scraping pages and draft custom namespaces are
outside this API.

## Events

The event UI formerly in `@atmo-dev/events-ui` lives in this package:

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { EventEditor, EventView, EventCard } from '@atmo-dev/kit/events';
	import type { EditorAdapter, EditorViewer } from '@atmo-dev/kit/events-data';

	let { adapter, viewer, event, data, pageUrl } = $props();
</script>

<EventCard {event} />
<EventEditor {adapter} {viewer} eventData={event} actorDid={event.did} rkey={event.rkey} />
<EventView {adapter} {viewer} {data} {pageUrl} />
```

- `@atmo-dev/kit/events`: event cards, views, editor, RSVP/attendee/comment UI, starter-pack actions, conference timetable, VOD player/transcript and date/time/image controls. Event backgrounds and editor sections stay internal.
- `@atmo-dev/kit/events-data`: structural event types, adapter contracts, conference/date helpers, URL helpers, theme values, linked-record types and thumbnail selection. This entry is safe in plain Node and server routes: no Svelte, CSS, maps or players are loaded. Browser helpers such as `compressImage` only access browser APIs when called.
- `@atmo-dev/kit/events/editor`: `buildEventRecord` and `buildThumbnailMedia` for hosts that need explicit record construction. This separate entry includes browser-oriented thumbnail code; it is not part of the pure data API.

Apps implement `EditorAdapter` for authentication prompts, repository IO, uploads, save/delete navigation, and optional linked-record transport/indexing notifications. Keep sessions, Cloudflare bindings, app routes, server endpoints, caching and moderation in the app. The editor/view never imports a consumer's app state. Existing `EventView` page-data shape and RSVP behavior are preserved in this migration.

Full event UI requires optional peers (ordinary Kit consumers do not):

```sh
pnpm add maplibre-gl@^6.16.0 svelte-maplibre-gl@^2.2.1 plyr@^3.8.5
```

Import `theme.css` as above; it scans the packaged event components too, so no separate Tailwind source path is needed. Event exports are intentionally absent from the main Kit entry.

The initial move preserves legacy defaults: `/p/:actor/e/:rkey` event and `/p/:actor` profile links, `/api/geocoding`, Bluesky's public comments API, the `?created` share flow and RSVP's `createdWith` identifier. Hosts currently need compatible routes/endpoints; `shareUrlOverride` changes outbound share links. These defaults are not a new universal routing contract. Further host-policy extraction can happen independently of the package move.

Event browser tests are in `src/tests/events`; run `pnpm test:unit --run --project events`. `pnpm test:package` checks the actual built server entry and its runtime import graph without Vite aliases.

## Photos, Grain albums and Streamplace

`PhotoGrid` and `PhotoLightbox` work with provider-neutral `Photo[]` data (`src`, optional `thumbnail`, `alt`, dimensions and `contentWarning`). The grid preserves natural image proportions in responsive masonry columns, with a subtle 2% hover zoom disabled for reduced motion. It gates warned images before mounting them and opens a borderless fullscreen viewer. The viewer has a dimmed backdrop, previous/next arrows, close and a small photo-position counter; native horizontal scrolling with CSS scroll snap makes photos follow your finger or trackpad, with inertia rather than switching only on release. Mouse/pen drags also move the track directly. Swipes loop like the arrows; vertical pans do not navigate and controls are separate from the drag surface. Native pinch zoom, arrow keys, Escape, focus trapping and restoration are preserved; release animations respect reduced motion. `PhotoLightbox` also works independently with `bind:open` and `bind:index`; callers using it directly must first filter or reveal any warned photos. Apps own URL validation and moderation policy.

`GrainAlbumPicker`, `GrainAlbumView` and `StreamplacePicker` take explicit callbacks. They own presentation, pending/error states and stale-read protection—not sessions, event records, persistence, routes or caching. Picker selection callbacks can return a user-facing error string to keep the dialog open. See the offline examples at `/components`.

```svelte
<GrainAlbumPicker
	bind:open
	actor={viewer.did}
	listAlbums={photos.listAlbums}
	loadAlbum={photos.getGallery}
	onselect={(album) => attachAlbum(album)}
/>
<GrainAlbumView reference={albumUri} loadAlbum={photos.getGallery} />
<StreamplacePicker
	bind:open={streamOpen}
	actor={viewer.handle}
	{resolveHandle}
	onselect={(stream) => attachStream(stream.url)}
/>
```

`photos` implements the framework-free `GrainClient` contract from `@atmo-dev/kit/grain`: `getGallery(reference)` and `listAlbums(actor, cursor?)`, returning normalized `GrainGallery`/`GrainAlbumPage` data. The UI does **not** select a backend or fetch a default app route. An atmo.pics/Contrail implementation can replace the provider later without changing the pickers, gallery or lightbox.

For now, `createGrainXrpcClient(fetchImpl?)` provides the Grain.social implementation: its fixed public `social.grain.unspecced.getGallery` and `dev.hatk.getFeed` endpoints, response normalization, CDN validation, content-warning flags, five-second timeouts and no redirects. It performs no IO until a method is called. Apps choose where it runs and own any proxy endpoint, cache, authentication or additional moderation. No arbitrary-origin proxy option is exposed.

`parseGrainLink` is exported from `@atmo-dev/kit/grain`, `parseStreamplaceLink` from `@atmo-dev/kit/streamplace`, and `Photo` from `@atmo-dev/kit/media`. The main entry point exports these too. Grain URLs normalize to DID-based links after loading; handles and percent-encoded DID identifiers are accepted. These helpers validate syntax only, not account existence.

## Read-only profiles

`UserProfile` displays a Bluesky profile header: banner, avatar, name, handle, pronouns, optional counts, bio, modern profile links, and a DID-based “View on Bluesky” link. It has no editing or follow behavior. An optional `actions` snippet holds app-owned controls. `metrics={[{ label: 'events created', value: 12 }]}` replaces the default Bluesky counts; `metrics={[]}` hides all counts.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { UserProfile, blueskyProfileToProfileData } from '@atmo-dev/kit';

	// Fetch and apply moderation in the app, not in the component.
	let { profileView } = $props();
	let profile = $derived(blueskyProfileToProfileData(profileView));
</script>

{#if profile}<UserProfile {profile} />{/if}
```

`ProfileData` can also be supplied directly. Bios remain escaped plain text with detected HTTP(S) links, mentions and hashtags; newlines are preserved. There is no HTML/Markdown interpretation, DOM sanitizer, client-only rendering, or mention-resolution request. Link destinations and images reject executable schemes and credential-bearing URLs. External links use `noopener noreferrer`; user links also use `nofollow ugc`.

`blueskyProfileToProfileData` accepts an `app.bsky.actor.getProfile` view and validates optional fields. Its `links` must be hydrated `app.bsky.actor.link` views (`url`, optional `title` and `icon` image URL), not the profile record's ordered strongRefs. It omits unresolved refs and labeled links conservatively, deduplicates destinations, and displays at most ten. The legacy `website` field is deliberately ignored. Apps own hydration, account moderation and any more specific link-moderation policy. Supplied icons render as small decorative images; unsafe or failed icons fall back to text-only links. No link metadata or destination is fetched by the component.

## Bluesky comments and embeds

`NestedComments` renders `PostData[]` with recursive replies and compact reply, repost, and like icon/count links. Counts default to zero; each link has a full accessible label and opens the post in the viewer's preferred social client. These are outbound links, not authenticated engagement buttons.

Use `blueskyPostToPostData(postView)` to convert public AppView posts, including `repostCount`. `PostContent` supports images, galleries, external link cards, HLS video, quoted posts (including their embeds), record-with-media combinations, feeds, lists, starter packs, and moderation-service cards. Missing, blocked, and detached quotes have readable placeholders; unknown embed variants show an unavailable fallback. Quote nesting is capped at three levels. Non-post record cards use Bluesky routes, since other clients may not implement them. Apps still own fetching and moderation.

### Special link embeds

External links use an ordered provider registry. YouTube watch, short, live, embed, and `youtu.be` links get a click-to-load, privacy-enhanced player. No YouTube iframe or SDK is loaded before activation; the preview uses only the supplied AppView thumbnail. Klipy's `static.klipy.com/ii/...` media links render GIFs or looping, muted video using Bluesky's media proxy, preserving the GIF description as alt text. Klipy media autoplays and loops without native video controls or a caption row. A small corner-overlay pause/play button controls the animation; pausing video preserves its current frame. With reduced motion enabled, it stays on the preview until explicitly played. Ordinary Klipy page links without a usable media URL remain link cards; no metadata API or API key is needed. Unknown URLs and playback failures fall back to the original link card.

Pass `embedProviders` to `PostContent` or `NestedComments` (it propagates to all replies and quotes). Omit it for YouTube + Klipy, or pass `[]` to disable special players. Add providers without modifying the renderer:

```ts
import { defaultExternalEmbedProviders, type ExternalEmbedProvider } from '@atmo-dev/kit/social';

const exampleProvider: ExternalEmbedProvider = {
	id: 'example',
	label: 'Example',
	resolve(url) {
		if (url.hostname !== 'example.com') return null;
		const id = /^\/watch\/([a-zA-Z0-9_-]+)$/.exec(url.pathname)?.[1];
		return id ? { type: 'iframe', src: `https://player.example.com/embed/${id}` } : null;
	}
};
const embedProviders = [exampleProvider, ...defaultExternalEmbedProviders];
```

Providers are trusted app-owned, synchronous URL resolvers returning `iframe`, `video` (typed sources), or `image` descriptors—not HTML. Match exact hosts, validate IDs, and construct known player URLs. Media descriptors can set `autoplay: true` and videos can set `controls: false` for GIF-like playback; iframe players always require a click. The shared `ExternalEmbed` renderer owns playback policy, reduced-motion handling, sandboxed iframes, safe URL schemes, pause controls, source-change resets, and fallback cards. It is also exported for standalone use.

## Preferred social client

`SocialClientPicker` is a native form field group for Bluesky, mu, Blacksky, Witchsky, or a custom web client. Pass the viewer's saved `value` (a `PreferredSocialClient`, or `null` for Bluesky) and optionally `disabled`. It submits `client` and, for custom clients, `customUrl`. The app owns the form, save button, authentication, and feedback.

The dedicated public record is `social.atmo.actor.preferredClient/self`:

```json
{ "$type": "social.atmo.actor.preferredClient", "client": "mu" }
```

For a custom client, use `"client": "custom"` and `"customUrl": "https://example.com"`. This lexicon stores **only social-client selection**, not general preferences. Its schema is available at `@atmo-dev/kit/lexicons/social.atmo.actor.preferredClient.json`.

Framework-free helpers are exported from `@atmo-dev/kit/social` (and the main entry point):

- `PREFERRED_CLIENT_COLLECTION`, `PREFERRED_CLIENT_RKEY`, `PREFERRED_CLIENT_SCOPE` for repository IO and OAuth metadata/incremental permission requests. The scope grants create/update only on this collection; request it when the user chooses to authorize this setting, not during normal login or signup.
- `parsePreferredSocialClient(record)` validates repository records or form input; invalid, unknown or absent selections return `null`.
- `preferredSocialClientRecord(selection)` builds a validated record. Never write merely because a read failed; distinguish `RecordNotFound` from PDS/network failures, and use `swapRecord` to guard updates.
- `socialClientInfo(selection)`, `socialProfileUrl(actor, selection)`, `socialPostUrl(atUri, selection)`, and `socialHashtagUrl(tag, selection)` default to Bluesky. `socialPostUrl` accepts feed-post AT URIs and returns `null` for invalid ones. Custom URLs must be absolute HTTP(S), without credentials, query or fragment, and support `/profile/:actor` routes. Base paths are preserved.

Read the signed-in viewer's record from their PDS, include the parsed selection in viewer data, and pass it to `<UserProfile {profile} socialClient={viewer.preferredSocialClient} />`. The profile's external button and handle link use that client. Pass the same `socialClient` prop to `NestedComments` for author, reply, repost, like, and quoted-post links, including nested replies. Changing the selection updates these links without changing the stored post data. Bio hashtags also use the selected client. Supply an app-owned `mentionUrl` callback to `UserProfile` (for example, `(actor) => '/p/' + encodeURIComponent(actor)`) to route bio mentions locally in the same tab; without it they open the selected social client. Post-content facets retain their existing Bluesky links. Apps remain responsible for server-side authorization, IO, incremental authorization when access is missing, and invalidating viewer data after saves.

## Login identifiers

`LoginForm` and `LoginDialog` accept handles and DIDs by default. Handles are trimmed, stripped of leading `@` characters, and lowercased. DIDs are trimmed only: method-specific case and percent encoding are preserved. `initialHandle` also accepts a DID; its existing name is retained for compatibility.

The `login(identifier, actor?, options?)` and `onSuccess(identifier, actor?)` callbacks receive that identifier unchanged after normalization. A manually entered DID does not fabricate profile data or a recent-account record. Optional permission review works the same for either identifier.

Validation is syntactic, not proof that an account exists. Apps own DID resolution, supported DID methods, OAuth, and sessions. DID inputs bypass optional handle-search providers and cancel pending suggestions.

For other login entry points, import `normalizeIdentifier` and `isValidIdentifier`. Existing `normalizeHandle` and `isValidHandle` remain handle-only helpers; do not use them on DIDs.

## Legal pages and footer

`LegalDocument` renders app-owned document data with readable typography and an optional app-reviewed revision date. Publication status is metadata, not a visible page label. `LegalFooter` renders only configured links. Preview the actual pages at `/legal`; authoring configuration and diagnostics have their own view.

```svelte
<script lang="ts">
	import { LegalDocument, LegalFooter } from '@atmo-dev/kit';
	import { privacy } from './reviewed-policies';
</script>

<LegalDocument document={privacy} />
<LegalFooter
	links={{
		terms: '/terms',
		privacy: '/privacy',
		imprint: '/imprint',
		moderation: false,
		report: '/report',
		source: { label: 'Source code', href: 'https://github.com/example/project' }
	}}
/>
```

Every destination is optional: omit it or set it to `false` to hide it. A string uses the default label; `{ label, href }` customizes it. Plain `mailto:` destinations are accepted for reporting. Unsafe URLs are not made clickable. No links/actions means no empty footer. The footer forwards native attributes and `class`.

An app-owned `reportAction` snippet replaces `links.report` with a contextual button/dialog trigger. Setting `links.report: false` disables that action too. The footer owns no session, reporting subject, dialog, or network operation.

### Author and review documents

Import framework-free helpers from `@atmo-dev/kit/legal` in a script:

```ts
import { createLegalDrafts, getLegalDraftIssues } from '@atmo-dev/kit/legal';

const config = {
	app: { name: 'Example', url: 'https://example.com', description: 'an event app' },
	operator: { name: 'Operator', email: 'hello@example.com', address: [] },
	privacy: [
		{
			id: 'storage',
			title: 'Data storage',
			paragraphs: [
				'Describe actual data, purposes, recipients, retention, legal bases, and safeguards.'
			]
		}
	],
	moderation: [
		{
			id: 'reports',
			title: 'Reporting',
			paragraphs: ['Describe the working report channel and review procedure.']
		}
	]
};
console.error(getLegalDraftIssues(config));
console.log(JSON.stringify(createLegalDrafts(config), null, 2));
```

Save generated documents in the consuming app, review/edit their wording, and render that snapshot—not a runtime call to `createLegalDrafts`. **A Kit upgrade must not silently rewrite a published policy.** The templates are drafts, not legal advice or a guarantee of compliance. They infer no jurisdiction, age threshold, legal basis, retention period, processor agreement, acceptance flow, or notice commitment. Operator facts can be reused across apps; each app still needs its actual processing and terms reviewed.

`LegalDocumentData` contains a `title`, `status: 'draft' | 'published'`, optional app-owned `updated` date, and `sections`. Each section has a unique `id`, `title`, and optional `paragraphs`, `items`, `address`, and `links`. Text is escaped, not rendered as HTML. Templates provide terms, privacy, imprint, and moderation drafts, but apps can supply their own text/documents and external policy links instead.

Set `status: 'published'` and an ISO `updated` date only after review. `getLegalDocumentIssues` checks publication fields and section identifiers; `getLegalDraftIssues` checks authoring configuration. Neither determines legal compliance. Routes, page titles, indexing of draft pages, notice/acceptance mechanisms, and enforcement remain app-owned.

## Reporting

`ReportDialog` owns the reason/details form, pending and success states, and the signed-out email fallback. Apps own the trigger, sessions, subject references, canonical links, mailbox, and server submission.

```svelte
<ReportDialog
	bind:open
	isLoggedIn={viewer.isLoggedIn}
	email="reports@example.com"
	subjectUrl={canonicalUrl}
	onsignin={showLogin}
	submit={async (input) => {
		try {
			await sendReport({ subject, ...input });
		} catch {
			return { message: 'Reporting is unavailable. Please report by email.' };
		}
	}}
/>
```

`submit` receives `{ reasonType, reason? }`, using the standard ATProto spam, violation, and other reason identifiers. Blank details are omitted; entered details are trimmed and limited to 2,000 characters. Resolve with no value after a successful save, or return `{ message, needsSignIn? }` for a safe, user-facing failure. `needsSignIn` offers a sign-in-again action. Unexpected rejections show a generic failure without exposing exception details.

The email fallback prefills the subject link and any entered details. Opening a new dialog or changing `subjectUrl` resets its state; stale async results are ignored. The dialog does not import an app's auth singleton, contact a moderation service, or decide who can report a subject. Server authorization remains mandatory.
